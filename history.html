        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-center">History of the Taj Mahal</h2>
        <div class="mt-3 text-lg text-justify">
            <p>The history of the Taj Mahal dates back to the 17th century when Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan decided to build a grand mausoleum in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died in 1631 while giving birth to their 14th child. Devastated by her loss, Shah Jahan envisioned a monument that would stand as a timeless tribute to their love. The construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and took approximately 22 years to complete, with the main mausoleum finished by 1648 and the surrounding structures completed in 1653. Over 20,000 artisans, laborers, and craftsmen from across the Mughal Empire, as well as from Persia, the Ottoman Empire, and Central Asia, were employed in its construction.</p>

            <p class="mt-3">The Taj Mahal was designed by Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, a prominent architect of the Mughal court, and showcases a perfect fusion of Persian, Islamic, and Indian architectural styles. The white marble used for the structure was transported from Makrana in Rajasthan, while precious and semi-precious stones such as jasper, jade, turquoise, and onyx were sourced from various parts of Asia. The intricate inlay work, calligraphy, and geometric designs reflect the Mughal love for fine artistry.</p>

            <p class="mt-3">However, the later years of Shah Jahan's life were filled with turmoil. In 1658, his son Aurangzeb overthrew him and imprisoned him in Agra Fort, where he spent his final years gazing at the Taj Mahal from a window until his death in 1666. After his passing, Shah Jahan was laid to rest beside Mumtaz Mahal inside the Taj Mahal. Over the centuries, the monument faced threats from invasions, colonial rule, and environmental damage. During British rule in India, parts of the Taj Mahal’s precious stones were looted, and the gardens were altered to resemble English-style lawns.</p>

            <p class="mt-3">Despite these challenges, extensive restoration efforts in the 20th and 21st centuries have helped preserve the Taj Mahal’s grandeur. Today, it stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and remains one of the most visited and admired monuments in the world, attracting millions of tourists each year who come to witness its breathtaking beauty and historical significance.</p>
